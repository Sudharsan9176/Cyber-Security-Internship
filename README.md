# Cyber Security Internship – Task 1

## Task Title
Understanding Cyber Security Basics & Attack Surface

## Description
This repository contains Task 1 of my Cyber Security Internship.  
The task focuses on understanding cyber security fundamentals, CIA Triad, attack surfaces, common attackers, OWASP Top 10, and basic data flow with attack points.

## What I Learned
- Basics of cyber security and its importance
- Understanding confidentiality, integrity, and availability
- Different types of attack surfaces
- Common cyber attackers and their motivations
- Importance of OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- How data flows through applications and where attacks can occur

## Files Included
- Cyber_Security_Task1.pdf

## Tools Used
- Browser for self-research
- GitHub for documentation and submission

## Outcome
This task helped me build a strong foundation in cyber security concepts and improved my awareness of real-world cyber threats.
# Cyber Security Internship – Task 2

## Task Title
Operating System Security Fundamentals (Linux & Windows)

## Objective
The objective of this task is to understand operating system–level security concepts and learn how proper configuration and hardening can reduce security risks in Linux and Windows environments.

## Tools Used
- Ubuntu Linux (Virtual Machine)
- Windows Defender & Windows Security Settings
- VirtualBox

## Task Overview
This task focuses on basic operating system security mechanisms such as user management, access control, file permissions, firewall configuration, and service management. The goal is to understand how misconfigurations can increase system vulnerabilities and how hardening techniques help protect systems from attacks.

## Key Concepts Covered
- User accounts and access control
- Administrator vs standard user privileges
- Linux file permissions (read, write, execute)
- Permission commands: `ls -l`, `chmod`, `chown`
- Firewall configuration (UFW / Windows Firewall)
- Running processes and services
- Operating system hardening basics
- Principle of least privilege

## OS Hardening Practices
- Use strong passwords and restrict administrative access
- Avoid using root/administrator accounts for daily activities
- Disable unnecessary services and open ports
- Enable and configure firewall rules
- Keep the operating system updated
- Regularly review user accounts and permissions

## Deliverables
- OS Security Checklist Document (PDF)
- Practical understanding of OS security fundamentals

## Final Outcome
By completing this task, I gained a clear understanding of how operating systems enforce security at the user, file, and service levels. This task strengthened my knowledge of system hardening techniques that help reduce attack surfaces in both Linux and Windows environments.
